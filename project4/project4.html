        <h1>RE-AL</h1>
        <p>In my project I’m investigating the question of human deprivation of nature and how we are finding ways of reflecting nature back to us.
            I pursue the idea of creating artificial organisms as a symbol of marriage between technology and nature. I emphasise on tactile materials that mimic organic forms and shapes, studying the science of biomimicry </p>
